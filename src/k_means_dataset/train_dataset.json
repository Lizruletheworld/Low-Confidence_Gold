With platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, it's easier for people to stay in the know and interact with friends and family, as well as thousands of other users. In addition to connecting with other people, social media can also be used to inform. For example, many news outlets use Twitter to post stories and updates that are related to the topics they cover. Others use the platform to share pieces of information and engage in discussion, as well as post pictures and videos of events as they happen, as was done during the Arab Spring.\n\nSocial media has also changed the landscape of modern marketing, allowing smaller business and organizations to reach a broader range of people. Companies and charities can use social media to promote their products, events, and causes to potential customers, donors, and followers. Social media has starkly altered how people raise awareness and money for causes, creating a more direct method for users to donate instead of relying on sponsored advertisements or traditional fundraising methods.\n\nMoreover, social media has impacted politics and political campaigns around the world. Candidates are now able to spread their message beyond traditional avenues like protests and rallies, and use social media to reach voters and supporters. During the 2016 US election, for example, candidates on all sides used Twitter to announce their candidacies, post policy platforms, debate with opponents, and more.

Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.[2]\n\nDeep-learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, deep reinforcement learning, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks and transformers have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, climate science, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.[3][4][5]\n\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems. ANNs have various differences from biological brains. Specifically, artificial neural networks tend to be static and symbolic, while the biological brain of most living organisms is dynamic (plastic) and analog.[6][7]\n\nThe adjective \"deep\" in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the network. Early work showed that a linear perceptron cannot be a universal classifier, but that a network with a nonpolynomial activation function with one hidden layer of unbounded width can. Deep learning is a modern variation that is concerned with an unbounded number of layers of bounded size, which permits practical application and optimized implementation, while retaining theoretical universality under mild conditions. In deep learning the layers are also permitted to be heterogeneous and to deviate widely from biologically informed connectionist models, for the sake of efficiency, trainability and understandability.\n","cluster":29},{"instruction":"Name the two main components of a machine learning system.","input":"","cluster":29},{"instruction":"Provide an overview of the process of developing a machine learning model.","input":"","cluster":29},{"instruction":"Give a title to this article.","input":"This article focuses on the analysis of the predictive power of machine learning models based on their hyperparameters tuning.","cluster":29},{"instruction":"Write a detailed introduction to the subject of machine learning.","input":"","cluster":29},{"instruction":"What are the main steps used in Machine Learning?","input":"","cluster":29},{"instruction":"What is the source of the data for a typical machine learning project?","input":"","cluster":29},{"instruction":"Provide a set of criteria for evaluating machine learning models.","input":"","cluster":29},{"instruction":"Please explain the concept of machine learning in an easy to understand way.","input":"","cluster":29},{"instruction":"Generate an example of how the given technology works.","input":"Machine Learning","cluster":29},{"instruction":"Summarize this article about machine learning.","input":"\"Machine learning is an area of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and systems that can learn from and make predictions from data.

What is a printing hack people are NOT talking about?\nIn regards to printing on black shirts, if you make a mistake by perhaps getting a spot of ink somewhere it is not supposed to be - DO NOT DRY IT! That garment is likely very salvageable in a super quick and easy way if the ink is not cured. Simply apply a little water to a q-tip or maintenance swab or even TAPE! With the water based textile printing ink, you can easily remove that mess up spot and save the garment AND the time\/ink involved in reproducing the piece.\n\n2. What is a key to longevity in this industry?\nListen to the customer and what their needs are for THEM to be successful in this business and then create solutions that are COST EFFECTIVE.

There are so many options from desktop paper transfers, sublimation, laser engraving, screen printing - in 2022, there are no shortages of options to fit every volume and every budget and trade shows are a GREAT place to see what's out there.\n\n5.

It's an engaging, non-commercial Sci-fi film that is well acted, directed and produced. It held my attention and made me want to find out the fate of the ship and crew.\n\nI knew nothing of the poem. I knew nothing other than what the trailer contained. It is incredibly difficult to adapt a poem which is tied more than any other literary form to the word, into a mostly visual medium. Since the screenwriter seemed to jettison the words of the poem what we are left with is an outline. That's where some problems begin. The poem was written in 1956, when space travel hadn't even started. So, it's pretty lame when a space ship the size of the Aniara doesn't have redundant power and a number of backup plans for when\/if things go wrong. But hey, we're already in outer space, disbelief is suspended, so, shut the hell up. There's a bunch character driven scenes but none of character ever develop. The really all stay the same no matter what they've been through. Also Instead of a fully developed story we get inundated with a series of let downs which really come off as more of a drag than tragic. I mean would it really be that bad to be traveling through space? The filmmakers certainly seem sure it is. There's some poignant moments throughout, to be sure. The problem is it's all for a movie that just peters out. What may have had great resonance on the page doesn't make it through the translation to screen.\n\nI think if they had stronger conclusion to what happens to the main character at the end the movie would've worked better. That way the ultimate ending would've become a post script. That didn't happen, so we're left with a movie that just stops on some sort of note about 'the vastness of space'.\n\nAll this makes 'Aniara' unsatisfying even though it's well done on many levels.","cluster":36},{"instruction":"Rewrite the following fictional character's biography using the third person point of view.","input":"I was born in a small rural town in England, and I always had a sense of adventure and wanderlust.","cluster":36},{"instruction":"What book is described below?","input":"A science-fiction novel written by one of the greatest living authors, unfolds in a future America where individuals are assigned a predetermined social class and subjugation is the law of the land.","cluster":36},{"instruction":"Determine the type of the following text.
